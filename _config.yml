  I study fundamental deformation and strengthening mechanisms at the nano and mesoscale to inform the design of novel alloy systems. I leverage and extend existing computational approaches to accomplish these goals. 
  Skills honed during my PhD include:
  - Molecular Dynamics/Monte Carlo methods (LAMMPS)
  - Concurrent Atomistic-Continuum multiscale modeling (CAC)
  - Data analysis and visualization (Scipy, Jupyter, Pandas)
  - Scientific software development (MPI, Fortran90, C++)
  - Scripting and automation (Python, BASH)

          - Selected for Naval Research Enterprise Intern Program (NREIP) at the US Naval Research Lab.
          - Designed large-scale Monte-Carlo (MC) annealing algorithms to develop short-range solute ordering in complex alloy systems.
          - Created a Python-based tool to process both atom-probe tomography datasets and MC-computed microstructures to directly quantify cluster size and distributions.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
